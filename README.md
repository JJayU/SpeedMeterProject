App connects via Bluetooth with Arduino with HC-06 module. Arduino acts as speedometer and counts wheel rotation time. This time is then sent to Android app to be processed.

Application displays actual speed, total time, distance and average speed.
In the future there will be possibility to save these data to .tcx file and export it to Strava.
